Makefcfg 1.0  -- A Fractint video utility by The Stone Soup Group 

Makefcfg reads your VESA Video BIOS and writes a Fractint 
   fractint.cfg file with VESA video modes set up.

Syntax: makefcfg [commands ...]
   optional commands (space separated) include:
      16        -- causes 16 color modes to be included
      true      -- causes true color modes to be included
      <fkey>    -- starting Fractint video mode key. <fkey> is 
                   one of F1, F2, ..., AF1, AF2, ..., CF1, CF1 ...
      overwrite -- program will overwrite fractcfg.old if it exists
                   (note: fractint.cfg is always saved to fractcfg.old)

You can abbreviate the overwrite and true commands with 'o' and 't'.
The idea of allowing you to set the starting function key is to facilitate
inserting the resulting fractint.cfg file inside your existing fractint.cfg.
When using this command, don't type in '<' or '>'; these symbols just indicate
that <fkey> is not literally what you type - you type in F1, F2, etc.

This utility is particularly useful for setting up Fractint to use
semi-standard VESA video modes such as 1600x1200. As of Fractint version 20
the truecolor modes are still not very useful, so this capability looks to 
the future.

Example: 

   makefcfg 16 AF1 overwrite

will create an fractint.cfg file with 256 color modes, 16 color modes, 
but no truecolor modes, with the function keys starting with AF1.
