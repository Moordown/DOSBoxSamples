    A. New Version 6 Features

	Instruction set support for all 80x86 processors including the
	  new Intel Pentium Pro (also refered to as the P6 or 686).

	Instrution set support for Intel's MMX instructions in the MMX
	  version of the Pentium and Pentium II.

        Added support for reassembly under TASM 5.0 and MASM 6.11 in
          addition to all older versions

	Added additional interrupt comments for FAT-32 and more

        New virtualization options to load analysis code into memory and
          "virtualize" the segment/offset to any 1MB address.  Useful
          for VxDs, Linear code, boot sectors, and EPROM file images.

        New "Execute" feature to let a program under analysis run for
          a short period to unpack and/or decrypt itself before
          disassembly.  Handles most packing methods including multi-
          encoded PKLITE files (like FORMAT.COM or other DOS files).

        Numerous improvements to VxD analysis and output, including
          using VxDjmp and VxDcall macros, OFFSET32 for 32-bit offsets,
          better handling of VxD with huge file segments, better
          relocation processing, and more.

        Documents hundreds of new VxD calls used in Windows 95

        New local/global index handling equates.  Allows conversion of
          indexes like [bp+4] to [bp+YOUR_LABEL_HERE] across the entire
          program or within a specific subroutine or procedure.

        Automatic labeling of passed parameters and locals for C code
          with special labels PARAMETER_x, and LOCAL_x.

        Display of subroutine parameter name on related PUSH prior to
          subroutine call (with option for numbering parameters with
          C or PASCAL calling conventions)

        New output style options:
                Space after opcode commas
                Place all data accesses within brackets
                Capitalize only registers
                Page breaks or continuous output

        Generate separate cross reference listing file

        Increased space available for symbols up to 40%, and space
          for cross reference information up to 10 times
