------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTPRINT.COM is a VERY simple formatter for the interrupt list.  Use
this program to prevent widow at the beginning of a function call,
number the pages, center the printout in elite (12 cps) mode, or create
a summary of the function calls.  After formatting is complete, the
total number of pages is displayed on the screen.

Usage:
   intprint [options] [lines_per_page [page_length]] <interrup.lst [>outfile]

where the options are:
	-b    boldface the title lines, Return:, and Notes: by overprinting
	-B    boldface by sending Epson control sequences

        -p    print the page number at the bottom center of each page

        -iN   indent the output N spaces.  The output device is assumed to be
              at least 80+N characters wide.
              NOTE: you must put the number immediately after the 'i', no
              blanks are allowed.

        -e    assume printer is in elite mode (96 characters per line), and
              indent the output eight spaces to center the printout.

        -E    assume the printer is an Epson FX80 or compatible, and send
              control sequences to place the printer in elite mode and center
              the printout.  This option overrides -e and forces -i8

        -I    assume the printer is capable of producing IBM character graphics

        -nN   assume N pages have already been printed, and start numbering
              at N+1.  This option allows you to create a properly-numbered
              printout even if there is not enough disk space to concatenate
              the parts of the interrupt list.  See the examples below.
              NOTE: you must put the number immediately after the 'n', no
              blanks are allowed.

	-rN:M print only pages N through M.  The entire input is processed
	      for use in -s and -f summaries (see below) even though only
	      a portion is formatted for printing.
	      NOTE: you must put the page numbers immediately after the 'r',
	      no blanks are allowed.

	-wN   (widow lines) search N lines from the end of the page for a
	      good place to break.  The default is ten lines; the valid
	      range is from 3 to one-half of the page length.

        -sfile  create a one-line-per-function summary and write it to "file"
              if -n is also given, the summary will be appended to "file",
              allowing a properly numbered summary file to be created even if
              there is not enough disk space to concatenate the parts of the
              list.  See the examples below.
              NOTE: you must put the filename immediately after the 's', no
              blanks are allowed.

        -ffile  create a file containing only the data structures described
              in the interrupt list.
              NOTE: you must put the filename immediately after the 'f', no
              blanks are allowed.

Options may not be combined; "-ep" is illegal and the "p" will be ignored.

Lines_per_page specifies how many lines to print on each page (including the
optional page number), and defaults to 60.

Page_length specifies how many lines are on a printed page.  If this value is
omitted, a form feed is used to skip to the next page.  If specified, line
feeds are used to skip to the next page.

The file to be formatted is read from standard input, and the formatted result
is sent to standard output.  Both may be redirected using the standard Unix or
MSDOS redirection characters < and >.  If you only want a summary file or
data formats file, redirect the output to the null device ("NUL" under MSDOS,
"/dev/null" under Unix).

EXAMPLES:
---------

        Print the interrupt list with page numbers, and create a summary file,
	without concatenating INTERRUP.A, INTERRUP.B, and INTERRUP.C:

                A> intprint -sb:interrup.sum -p <interrup.a >prn
		116 pages.   [screen output from INTPRINT]
		A> intprint -sb:interrup.sum -p -n116 <interrup.b >prn
		261 pages.   [screen output from INTPRINT]
		A> intprint -sb:interrup.sum -p -n261 <interrup.c >prn
		386 pages.   [screen output from INTPRINT]

        Create only a summary file:

                C> intprint -sinterrupt.sum <interrup.lst >nul

        Print the interrupt list on an Epson FX80, using 54 lines per page and
        omitting both page numbers and summary:

                C> intprint -E 54 <interrup.lst >prn

	Print the interrupt list using 120 lines on every 132-line page (using
	superscript mode, for example), and make divider lines using IBM
	character graphics:

                C> intprint -I 120 132 <interrup.lst >prn

	Print only pages 123 through 127, assuming that 106 pages are contained
	in the first section of the list:

		C> intprint -n106 -r123:127 <interrup.b >prn

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PORTABILITY:
------------

INTPRINT.C contains the source code for INTPRINT, for those people who are
using the interrupt list on a machine which does not run MSDOS.  This code has
been tested with Turbo C and Mach (BSD 4.3 Unix) "cc".
