  - pp. 79-82  Coverage analysis doesn't work with Pascal programs.


Appendix C, "Remote Profiling"
------------------------------
  The Windows initialization file WREMOTE.INI is no longer used by
  WREMOTE. Instead, WREMOTE looks in TDW.INI for its initialization
  information. When you run WRSETUP, it saves the same information to
  TDW.INI that it used to save to WREMOTE.INI. As was the case with 
  WREMOTE.INI, the remote configuration options are in the [WRemote] 
  section of TDW.INI.

  If you set up WREMOTE using a previous version of WRSETUP, you can 
  copy your old WREMOTE.INI settings to TDW.INI. Be sure to include the
  section header [WRemote].

  - p. 171  References to WREMOTE.INI should be changed to TDW.INI.
