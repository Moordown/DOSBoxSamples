This file describes possible solutions to two problems you might
encounter using certain display drivers with Resource Workshop.


256-Color bitmaps and RLE4 compression
--------------------------------------

Due to problems with many 256-color display drivers for Windows
3.x, saving a bitmap with the RLE4 compression feature of
Resource Workshop enabled can fail to produce valid output files.

Under Windows, the display driver is responsible for providing
RLE compression when it is requested. However, because many
display drivers do not implement this feature correctly, we
recommend that you take the following steps when attempting to
use RLE4 compression:

1. Save the bitmap with the compression option set to "None".
This ensures that you will have a usable copy of your bitmap if
the remaining steps are not successful.

2. Set the compression option to "RLE4".

3. Select Resource|Save Resource As and save the bitmap under a
different file name.

4. Select File|Open Project and load the compressed version of
the bitmap.

If you cannot load the compressed bitmap, you must use the
uncompressed bitmap file you saved in step 1.

If your 256-color driver fails to compress the bitmap correctly,
contact the display driver vendor.
