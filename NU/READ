**************************  General Information  ****************************

Many of the programs in Norton Utilities Version 4.5 and have been combined in
the Norton Utilities Version 5.0.  Most of the previous program names have also
been changed.  These utility changes are noted in the following list:

    Utility Name          4.5 Filename     5.0 Filename

  Batch Enhancer                BE ---------- BE
  Directory Sort                DS ---------- Speedisk
  Disk Information              DI ---------- Sysinfo
  Disk Test                     DT ---------- NDD
  File Attributes               FA ---------- Filefind
  File Date/Time                FD ---------- Filefind
  File Find                     FF ---------- Filefind
  File Information              FI ---------- Filefind
  Format Recover                FR ---------- Unformat
  File Size                     FS ---------- Filefind
  List Directory                LD ---------- Filefind

  Norton Control Center         NCC --------- NCC
  Norton Change Directory       NCD --------- NCD
  Norton Disk Doctor            NDD --------- NDD, DiskTool
  Norton Integrator             NI ---------- Norton
  Norton Utilities              NU ---------- DiskEdit, UnErase, DiskTool
  Quick UnErase                 QU ---------- UnErase
  Speed Disk                    SD ---------- Speedisk
  Safe Format                   SF ---------- SFormat
  System Information            SI ---------- Sysinfo
  Time Mark                     TM ---------- NCC
  Text Search                   TS ---------- FileFind
  UnRemove Directory            UD ---------- UnErase
  Volume Label                  VL ---------- NCD
  Wipe File                     Wipefile ---- WipeInfo
  Wipe Disk                     Wipedisk ---- WipeInfo

If the INSTALL program determines that Norton Utilities version 4.5 is already
installed on the user's hard disk, it offers the option of overwriting the old
version or saving the files in a backup directory.  Regardless of the option
chosen, the following 4.5 programs are always retained in the main NORTON
directory:

Directory Sort (DS.EXE)
File Attributes (FA.EXE)
File Date/Time (FD.EXE)
File Find (FF.EXE renamed to FL.EXE)
File Size (FS.EXE)
Line Print (LP.EXE)

These programs are preserved because command line users may find it easier to
continue using them rather than their replacements in the 5.0 package.  Users
may also have batch files that rely on these 4.5 commands.  The old FF.EXE is
renamed to FL.EXE so it doesn't conflict with the new FileFind.

Regardless of whether the old Utilities are installed, the user has the option
of renaming certain programs to two character names:

DISKEDIT.EXE can be renamed DE.EXE
SYSINFO.EXE can be renamed SI.EXE
SFORMAT.EXE can be renamed SF.EXE
SPEEDISK.EXE can be renamed SD.EXE
FILEFIND.EXE can be renamed FF.EXE

This will primarily benefit long-time Norton users who like abbreviations.



*********************  Additional Program Information  *********************


*****************
*** CALIBRATE ***
*****************

The following switches are not mentioned in the manual:

    /BLANK    Turns the screen blanker ON while performing Pattern Testing
    /NOCOPY   Don't make a duplicate copy of the track currently being tested


****************
*** DISKREET ***
****************

DISKREET Switches

Switches are available to turn DISKREET "OFF" and "ON".  The /OFF switch
may be used from a batch file prior to executing a program that generates
unwanted NDisk accesses (requests for a password).

     For example, MAP is a command which is used on NOVELL networks to locate
     network drives.  Unfortunately it also results in requests for DISKREET
     disk passwords.  To disable password prompting, create a batch file
     similar to the following:

          C:\NORTON\DISKREET /OFF
          MAP
          C:\NORTON\DISKREET /ON


XMS 2.0 SUPPORT

     DISKREET fully complies with the Lotus, Intel, Microsoft, AST Extended
     Memory Specification (LIM XMS 2.0).

     Some systems have available RAM in the address range above 640K and below
     the High Memory Area (HMA).  This memory is referred to as Upper Memory
     Blocks (UMB).  If the installed system supports this feature, DISKREET
     will take advantage of it.  If DISKREET uses an UMB, under 1K of LOW
     memory will be used by DISKREET.

     If you use a memory manager (e.g. QEMM or 386-MAX) to load programs into
     high DOS memory, you may wish to force DISKREET to avoid using UMB's by
     adding the /SKIPUMB switch.  For example:

          DEVICE = C:\NORTON\DISKREET.SYS /SKIPUMB


Use of the XMS High Memory Area

     When DISKREET uses the HMA, only 12K bytes of LOW memory are used.
     DISKREET will automatically use the HMA if it is available during
     initialization.  To make this memory area available, you must include
     an XMS driver in the CONFIG.SYS file BEFORE the DISKREET.SYS line.
     The file HIMEM.SYS (available free from Microsoft) can be used.

     If you intend to use Microsoft WINDOWS, DISKREET must not use the HMA.
     Add the /NOHMA switch to the DISKREET.SYS line.  For example:

                DEVICE = C:\NORTON\DISKREET.SYS /NOHMA

     DISKREET will then leave the HMA free for Windows use.  This switch can
     also be used to make more memory available for Desqview (using XDV).

     To force DISKREET to always load into low memory, use both the /NOHMA and
     /SKIPUMB switches and don't load the PCSHADOW.SYS driver.  Example:

                DEVICE = C:\NORTON\DISKREET.SYS /NOHMA /SKIPUMB

     If you are have network problems or are experiencing loss of characters
     during serial communications while using the HMA, you should add the
     /A20ON switch to the DISKREET.SYS line in the CONFIG.SYS file.

     For example:  DEVICE =  C:\NORTON\DISKREET.SYS /A20ON

     This switch will eliminate the overhead incurred from enabling/disabling
     the A20 line.  Note that this may cause other problems on some computers.


Support for COMPAQ 386 reserved memory.

     If you install DISKREET on a COMPAQ 386, DISKREET will use less than 900
     bytes of LOW memory.  A file PCSHADOW.SYS has been included on the
     distribution disks which reserves this memory for DISKREET.  If you use
     the installation program, CONFIG.SYS will be automatically updated.  To
     enable use of this memory by DISKREET the FIRST line in your CONFIG.SYS
     should reference this new file.  For example:

              DEVICE = C:\NORTON\PCSHADOW.SYS

     REMEMBER:  It must be the first line in your CONFIG.SYS file.

     NOTE:  If you are using COMPAQ's CEMM driver, the memory you save in
            DISKREET may be offset by the additional low memory used by the
            CEMM driver.


RAM Drives

     NDisks can be created on RAM drives providing that the sector size is set
     to 512 bytes (the default is usually 256 bytes)


DISKREET's Use of Sounds

     When using the audible prompt method to open an NDisk, you will hear
     different tunes.  Because DISKREET cannot display its audit screen, a
     special tune has been selected which indicates that a prior access was
     made and failed.  The tune sounds familiar to a European police car siren.
     If you hear this sound, you should open NDisk Manually (using
     DISKREET.EXE) in order to examine the audit information which contains a
     total count of failed accesses.


***************
*** INSTALL ***
***************

During the install, the program will prompt the user as to whether or not the
install program should rename DOS's FORMAT.COM to XXFORMAT.COM.  If this step
is completed and the user has DOS 4.xx, this will cause problems with the
execution of DOS 4.xx BACKUP.COM (DOS 4.xx looks for the presence of the file
FORMAT.COM during its execution).  If this problem occurs, simply rename
XXFORMAT.COM back to FORMAT.COM when using DOS 4.xx BACKUP.COM.


The Install program will prompt you as to whether or not you wish to install
PCSHADOW.  PCSHADOW is a reserved memory block manager for use will COMPAQ 386
class machines ONLY.  If you have a COMPAQ 386 class machine and are using
a memory manager (CEMM, QEMM or 386-MAX) you should NOT install PCSHADOW.


Custom Tailoring of Statements in AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS Files:

The Install program can place several of the Utilities programs into your
AUTOEXEC.BAT and/or CONFIG.SYS files if you wish.  Many of the defaults for
these programs may not be exactly what you want.  If you want to fine tune the
statements that the Install program has added to your Autoexec.bat or
Config.sys, YOU WILL NEED TO MANUALLY EDIT the file yourself.  You can use a
text editor to do this.  Please consult the documentation for the command line
parameters you can use to tailor these programs.


Optimizing the Scan at Install Startup:

You can quicken the time that it takes for the Install program to scan for
previously installed files by making sure that:

     o  You put all your Norton Utilities files into one directory

     o  The "NU" environment variable is set.  The Install program can do this
        for you.  You'll need to set the NU variable to the directory that
        contains your Norton Utilities files.


Passwords:

Please be aware that only ONE UNIQUE password can be set for ALL of the Norton
Utilities files that are able to be password protected.  You are not able to,
for example, set one password for NDD and another for UNFORMAT.


Archive File Extraction Errors:

Several of the Norton Utilities programs are compressed into archive files.  If
you encounter an error during the extraction of the programs from the archive
file, first try uncompressing them manually.  This is done by launching the
archive file with the destination drive and path name where you wish to install
the Norton Utilities:
     <Source Disk:Archive File Name> <Target Disk:\Directory>

     Example:

          A:NU5_ARC1.EXE C:\NORTON

If you still encounter an error, please call our Customer Service at
1-800-365-1010.


********************
*** NORTON CACHE ***
********************

NCACHE only works on "normally connected" floppies.  If a floppy drive requires
a special interface board and/or a driver loaded in CONFIG.SYS, NCACHE probably
won't be able to cache it.  Most external drives are not supported by NCACHE.

NCACHE does contain special code to support Bernoulli Boxes, including the
external models.  Other removable hard disks are not supported.

Both the Small and Fast versions of Norton Cache will refuse to cache a floppy
drive that does not have "Change Line" support.  This is a hardware feature on
the drive that tells the computer when a diskette has been removed.  360K
drives often do not have a change line, and thus cannot be cached.  Most other
drives (1.2M, 1.44M, etc.) will work OK.

NCACHE will automatically determine which drives can be cached.  If a drive
cannot be cached, NCACHE will either print "Cannot detect media change for
this drive" or simply omit the drive from its status display.

For 8088 or 80286 based machines:

     In order to use Expanded Memory (EMS) with NCACHE, you must have an
     Expanded Memory Manager that implements VERSION 4 of the EMS specification
     (sometimes called the "LIM" specification).  You must also have true EMS
     hardware and cannot use a software emulator like Above Disc.

     If you have an older memory manager, check with your memory board
     manufacturer to see if an upgrade is available.  In most cases all you'll
     need is new memory manager software; no hardware changes will be required.

     NCACHE will normally ignore EMS memory if you don't have the correct
     memory manager.  If you run NCACHE with no parameters it will simply skip
     over EMS and try to use extended or conventional memory instead.  If you
     provide an explicit EXP= parameter, you will receive an error message and
     NCACHE will not install itself.

For users of Xerox Ventura Publisher:

    One version of Ventura Publisher (VP) has problems working with NCACHE.
    The problems only occur with Version 2.0 of the VP Standard Edition.
    Users of that version may encounter machine lock ups during loading or
    "Internal Error 19" dialog boxes.

    There are a number of ways to work around this problem:  if you are
    loading NCACHE from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or from the DOS command line,
    try loading it from CONFIG.SYS instead.  If that doesn't work, try loading
    NCACHE before any other TSR's you are using.  If you aren't using any
    TSR's, try loading an additional copy of COMMAND.COM after NCACHE and
    before VP.

    If none of these changes solves the problem, you'll have no choice but
    to avoid running VP when NCACHE is loaded.  Xerox Software actually
    recommends that you run VP Standard Edition on a machine by itself, with
    no extra drivers or TSR's.  Future versions of VP (greater than 2.0) will
    have a different memory management system that should solve many driver
    and TSR problems.


*****************************
*** Norton Disk Doctor II ***
*****************************

The following switches are not mentioned in the manual:

    /REBUILD    Rebuilds an entire disk that has been destroyed
    /UNDELETE   Undelete a DOS partition that was previouly skipped


******************
*** SPEED DISK ***
******************

The DOS CHKDSK report and Speed Disk's Disk Information do not always agree on
the number of files and directories on a disk, when in fact BOTH are correct.
The reason is as follows:

     CHKDSK reports the number of hidden files and the number of user files
     separately, and the total of the sum of these will equal the number
     reported by Speed Disk.

     CHKDSK reports the number of sub-directories on a disk but does not count
     the root directory.  Speed Disk counts the root as a directory and will
     always report one more directory than CHKDSK.

     CHKDSK reports the volume label as a hidden file of 0 length.  Speed Disk
     doesn't include the volume label as a file.



**************************
*** System Information ***
**************************

The following switches are not mentioned in the manual:

    /AUTO     Unattended Scrolling through and repeatedly displaying of ALL
              the System Information Screens

    /DEMO     Unattended Scrolling only through the System Information
              Benchmark Screens

   /SUMMARY   Causes SysInfo to print the same information as SI v4.5 in a
              TTY display

************* Compatibility Issues and Additional Considerations ************

****************************************
*** Hard Disks with Cylinders > 1024 ***
****************************************

Norton Utilities Version 5.0 now provides various levels of support for
hard disks with more than 1024 cylinders.  Note that it will only support
drives of this type which are using Ontrack's Disk Manager or Storage
Dimension's SpeedStor.  All programs will work on these types of drives
transparently, except for the following limitations:

Calibrate   Will not perform a Low-Level Format on any DOS partition
            on the 1024+ cylinder drive.  Also won't test or optimize
            any DOS partition which lies BEYOND the 1024 cylinder
            boundary.
NDD         Will state that DOS partitions which lie BEYOND the 1024
            cylinder boundary are device-driven, which is TRUE.
SFormat     Can't Format DOS partitions which lie BEYOND the 1024
            cylinder boundary.


****************************************************
*** Multitasking with MS-WINDOWS, DESQVIEW, etc. ***
****************************************************

In general, applications or commands that modify the file allocation table can
cause unpredictable results when run under multitasking environments.

The following applications can be run directly from the DOS prompt:

Batch Enhancer    No problems.
DiskEdit          Should be run in read only mode.
Diskreet          For NDisks to work properly, the password prompting
                  option must be set to manual open.  When running under
                  DESQVIEW or WINDOWS, you should do the following:
                      -  Make all NDisks Manual open only
                      -  Disable Quick Close
                      -  Disable Auto Close Timeout
                      -  Disable Screen Clear and Keyboard Lock
FileFind          No problems.
FileFix           May cause problems when unzapping a dBASE file.
FileSave          As a general rule, FileSave should be turned on before
                  loading Windows.
                  For Advanced Users: Drives can be manipulated
                  independently from within separate instances of
                  command.com.
NCC               Under Windows, only effects the current instance of
                  command.com.
NCD               Only effects the current instance of command.com
System Info       The CPU Speed Benchmark will not reflect the true speed
                  of the computer.
Image             Should be run before loading Windows or Desqview.

****************
*** NETWORKS ***
****************

The Norton Utilities Version 5.0 can be installed on a network server.
In order to be used effectively in a networking environment, we recommend
the following:

                         NU Environment Settings

The Norton Utilities saves configuration information in initialization
files (*.INI).  Since each user on a network will most likely have a
unique hardware configuration, the NU environment variable must point
to a directory on the user's local hard disk.

For example, typing:

SET NU=C:\

will instruct the Norton Utilities to find information about the user's
computer in the root directory of his C: drive.  You should place this
statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.


                    Running FileSave and NCD on a network

FileSave      The first time FileSave is run on a network drive, it will
              create an invisible subdirectory off the root directory.
              This directory will be called TRASHCAN.  All users will
              need RIGHTS to this directory in order for FileSave to
              work correctly.  We recommend that the supervisor run
              FileSave first, then modify the directory attributes so
              all users have ALL RIGHTS, except SEARCH.

              FileSave must be loaded AFTER the network driver (e.g. IPX)
              and shell (e.g. NET3).  Loading FileSave before the network
              software will prevent it from protecting network drives.

NCD           NCD saves a copy of the directory tree on the drive, so that
              it doesn't have to scan the drive everytime it is run.  On
              a network drive, it will try to save the directory tree in
              a subdirectory called NCDTREE.  On non-network drives, the
              directory tree is saved in the root directory, but most
              networks don't give users any rights to the root directory.
              For this reason, in order to use NCD on a network drive,
              the supervisor should create a directory in the root
              directory called NCDTREE and give all users ALL RIGHTS to
              this directory.



*********************** Manual Corrections and Changes **********************

********************
*** USER'S GUIDE ***
********************

Page 18, Paragraph 1

     "By default, 11 of the programs are specified..." should be "By default,
     none of the programs are specified..."

Page 93, (Append to...)

     Append to reads "Add the contents of the tagged file to another file you
     specify."  This is incorrect.  Instead, it starts a Manual Unerase
     operation on the existing file (pre-adding the clusters in the file's
     allocation chain) so that new clusters can be added to the file.

Page 158, Paragraph 1

     There is INCORRECT INFORMATION in the last sentence of the paragraph which
     reads "Also, with the system area protected, WipeInfo could not wipe an
     unused cluster without your permission."  Actually, WipeInfo disables
     Disk Monitor, so any cluster can be wiped.

Pages 159-160

     Disk Monitor refers to an option called "Allow Floppy Format" which should
     actually be "Allow Floppy Access".

Page 161, Paragraph 2

     If a protected write occurs while the screen is in graphics mode--for
     example, while you are working with Windows--Disk Monitor can't pop up the
     dialog box.  Instead, it automatically rejects the write operation.  All
     you will hear is a beep.  The application that was attempting the write
     should issue a "write protect" or "access denied" error message

*** DISK EXPLORER ***
*********************

     "DOS 4.xx" should be "DOS 4.xx and higher"


****************  PROBLEMS, ERROR MESSAGES AND SOLUTIONS  *****************

In general, if things are not working the way you expect, check your
AUTOEXEC.BAT.  Some programs install a 2nd path statement instead of correctly
modifying the 1st one.  Also, check that the NU and/or NORTON environment
variables are set to the directory where Norton Utilities 5.0 is installed.
Finally, check both AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS for statements that you don't
recognize or that look out of place.


Message:  "Error obtaining directory information, insufficient memory."

Solution:  - Remove (unload) TSR's to free up RAM space
           - Remove some files from the directory (e.g., move files to another
             directory).
