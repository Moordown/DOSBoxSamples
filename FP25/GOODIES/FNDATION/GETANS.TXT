1.      You would add one READ level each time you selected an
        application from the menu and, therefore, would get 'Too many
        READs in effect." in short order.

2.      Because the procedure 'menuhit' is contained within EX1.MPR
        which is not part of EX1.PRG.

3.      It's found in function 'stopread' which is evaluated each time
        an application window is DEACTIVATEd.

4.      There are at most three READs active:  the Foundation READ,
        one of the application READs, and a READ MODAL associated with
        either 'browser' or 'finder'.

5.      The procedure named 'efface', which is called in the cleanup
        code for each application screen, insures that when the last
        application window is closed the control panel is released.

6.      The application READ has been terminated because its
        DEACTIVATE clause has returned .T. but the Foundation READ
        remains active.

7.      The Foundation READ is still active.

8.      The first application's DEACTIVATE clause returns .T. and,
        thereby, terminates that application READ.  Termination of the
        application READ triggers the Foundation READ's VALID clause.
        This routine, called 'myhandler', notes that WONTOP() is a new
        application READ then proceeds to execute the .SPR associated
        with that window.
