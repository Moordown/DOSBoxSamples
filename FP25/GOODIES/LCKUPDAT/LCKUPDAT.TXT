This directory, foxpro25\goodies\lckupdat, contains the files that are
needed to update 2.0 PLBs for use with FoxPro 2.5.  These files will allow
you to update PLBs that you have built using the Library Construction Kit.
If you obtained your PLBs from another source, e.g. a software supplier or
online service, then you should contact that source for updated libraries
that will work with FoxPro 2.5.  

To update your FoxPro 2.0 Library Construction Kit, all you have to do is
replace all the LCK library files and OBJ files with those found in this 
directory.  Relinking to these new libraries will create PLBs that can be 
used with FoxPro 2.5 for MS-DOS.  You may wish to copy your old libraries 
so that you can continue to generate 2.0 PLBs.

For example, if you installed the LCK in its default location, C:\FOXLCK,
and FoxPro 2.5 in its default location, C:\FOXPRO25, then you you might use 
the following steps to upgrade:

      mkdir c:\foxlck\20libs
      copy c:\foxlck\lib286\proapi*.lib c:\foxlck\20libs
      copy c:\foxlck\lib286\api*.obj c:\foxlck\20libs

      copy c:\foxpro25\goodies\lckupdat\*.lib c:\foxlck\lib286
      copy c:\foxpro25\goodies\lckupdat\*.obj c:\foxlck\lib286

After you've done this, you can rebuild your PLBs and use them with FoxPro 
2.5.
